I started my first official job as a PHP developer back in Aug 2004. However, I've been doing software development
for almost 15 years now, right after I got from USA in Oct 2003.

At the beginning I bought two books to learn _HTML 4.01_ and _Photoshop 6_. The term _web master_ or _web designer_
started to become popular, so I thought in order to _design_ you got to learn the best possible tool for it.

Soon enough I completed a freelance contract and earned my first $100.
The customer actually gave me a banknote with Benjamin Franklin instead of corresponding amount in _LVL_.
The project was simple - it consisted of raw _HTML_ files and a single _PHP_ function - _mail_.

Next I realized that cutting a _PSD_ file in pieces and produce _HTML_ out of it, adding behaviour to the page with _Javascript_ -
this is what I enjoy more, than moving pixels in _Photoshop_ here and there. This was not a surprise as I was already
comfortable with _Pascal_, which was the main language in early years of my University studies.

One of my class mates being a _Perl_ developer adviced me to learn _PHP_. So I bought my first _PHP_ book.

## What's the deal?

Allright, why am I telling all this? The thing is that for all these years I never had **a blog about software development**.
You can find my interviews, Github comments, Disqus discussions, Twitter messages, programming certificates,
open source libraries, but I've never really blogged.

What's the problem? Sign up with [Medium](https://medium.com) and go ahead. Well, having your own blog is not only
your thoughts on paper - your blog is how the whole damn thing works! It might sound stupid for modern age,
but this is how I always invisioned it and probably that's why was never able to start blogging.

## Finally

So here you're are... reading my blog. I'm completely aware that this might be the last post. Nevertheless it was fun
circling back in time while working on this document. Moreover I had to write at least one article in order
to generate few tags, categories, etc. Consider this a test entry with some thought.
